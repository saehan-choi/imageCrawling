# imageCrawling


you have to have chrome.exe tool, same version with chrome

    imgUrl = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="Sva75c"]/div/div/div[3]/div[2]/c-wiz/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div/a/img').get_attribute("src")
    
this code line(xpath) is important. if it change, it doesn't work
you can access F12, and copy XPath. ( only chrome, NO EDGE )
